this project is a proejct based learning for understanding how ring buffers work and to revise some c++ basics and learn more about computer networks.

Implemented a high-performance packet processing pipeline with invariant-based verification, golden-reference validation against tcpdump/Wireshark, deterministic replay using PCAP inputs, and backpressure testing under load.
